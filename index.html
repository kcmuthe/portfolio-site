        My name is Kenya Muthe, and I am a 4th year BAIS student at USF. I'm a bit uncertain about my future, and I'm not 100% sure what I want to do for work post-graduation, but I definitely would like to be a data analyst of some sort at a financial company. My dad is the owner of a stone fabrication and installation company, and he doesn't know much about using business and financial software to help him. He wants me to work for him and help him in better learning how to use these softwares to make his business grow and be more efficient.
